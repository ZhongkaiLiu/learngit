Git Notes:

1. Init a repo: $ git init

2. Add to stage: $ git add <filename>

3. Commit: $ git commit -m "comments here"

4. Check status: $ git status

5. Compare difference between work dir and stage: $ git diff
   Compare difference between work dir and HEAD: $ git diff HEAD
   Compare difference between work dir and stage for a specific file: $ git diff <filename>
   Compare difference between work dir and HEAD for a specific files: $ git diff HEAD -- <filename>   

6. Change version: $ git reset --hard <commit_id>
   <commit_id> can be 
   HEAD^ for previous 1st commit
   HEAD^^ for previous 2nd commit
   ...
   HEAD~100 for previous 100th commit

7. Check commit log: $ git log, to check the previous <commit_id>

8. Check command log: $ git reflog, to know the future <commit_id>

9. Working Directory => Stage => Branch(master)

10. Git tracks changes of files, not files.
    Only changes that are staged ($git add) can be commited to branch
